            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                South Korea is located on the Southern portion of the Korean Peninsula, off the 
                Southeastern coast of China.  It was formed at the end of Japanese occupation of
                Korea in 1945, when Soviets took control of the North, while the Allied forces 
                took control of the South.  The North later invaded the South to mark the beginning 
                of the Korean War in June, 1950.  A cease fire was later proposed in the form of
                the <em>Armistice Agreement for the Restoration of the South 
                Korean State</em>, which would officially divide the Korean Peninsula into two regions, 
                being separated by the 38th parallel.  South Korea never signed the Armistice.  The 
                Korean war was one of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War, with more than 3 
                million people killed.  Most of whom were civilians.  These events have shaped the 
                Korean Peninsula and provide some background and insight into the contemporary issues we will be covering.
