                <h3>A Crisis of Aging</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2016, OECD countries had an average poverty rate of about 11.7%, with elderly poverty being about 14%.<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/8483c82f-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/8483c82f-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>1</sup></a>  In comparison, the United States in 2022 has about an 11.5% overall poverty rate, with 10.5% of elders being in poverty.<a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/latest-census-bureau-data-shows-americans-65-only-group-to-experience-increase-in-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>2</sup></a> If we now look at South Korea, who has a top 10 GDP, we see that the poverty rate in 2019 was 16.3%, with the elderly rate being <strong>43.2%</strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8871725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>3</sup></a>  These are confounding data points that can only lead one to ask, how is it that in a highly developed country, nearly <em class="italics">half</em> of the elderly population are living in poverty?

                <h3>Western influence and Collectivism</h3>
                <p>
                    Because of War in the 1900's the Korean Peninsula was exposed to various cultures from superpower nations, including the United States, particularly in South Korea.  To this day, the United States maintains a significant military presence in South Korea, in order to mitigate threats from North Korea and other pacific opposition.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-usa-alliance-idUSKBN2AZ0S0/#:~:text=There%20are%20about%2028%2C500%20American,U.S.%20Defense%20Manpower%20Data%20Center." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>4</sup></a>  An interesting side effect of this, is that Korean families have begun to mirror the behaviors of American families, where children will move out of their parents homes to start families of their own.  However, because South Korea has been a highly collectivist nation, who relied on strong family systems that were self-sufficient, there are no systems in place to support those elderly whose children move out.  Unless they were still engaged in skilled work, or their children were very well off financially, it is likely that these older people become impoverished.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8871725/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>5</sup></a>

                <h3>Ageism</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to the lack of adequate pensions and government programs to support elderly, South Korea has a major problem with regards to ageism in the work place.  Employers are much less likely to hire elderly people, and because most businesses in South Korea pay employees proportionately to how long they have worked, those that are able to find work will receive less than adequate pay.<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/19/time-running-out-south-korea-end-age-discrimination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>6</sup></a>  This is contributing to a rising suicide rate, which increases as people age, with over <strong>60%</strong> of people over 80 committing suicide.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>7</sup></a>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Clearly, poverty amongst elderly people in South Korea is a major problem that deserves more attention.  Much of our discussions this term centered around poverty.  How does poverty happen, and what are the mechanisms that perpetuate it?  In South Korea, ironically, high collectivism and reliance on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363941/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filial piety</a> are major contributing factors, as the government and legal system are set up to accommodate only these families.  By implementing laws to prevent employer discrimination of elderly, alongside a pension system that would ensure adequate retirements, poverty within elderly populations might be significantly reduced.
