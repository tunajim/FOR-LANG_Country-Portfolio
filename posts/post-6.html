                Post 6: Political Issue: Human Rights

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>

                    Overall, South Korea is a modern nation who treats its citizens well, but there are caveats that bring up concerns with regards to human rights.  For instance, the country is generally unaccepting of LGBT members, and those people can be subject to discrimination.  There are also issues regarding gender relations discussed in <a href="../posts/post-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post #5</a>.  Abuses often occur within the workplace, with workers having no effective way of protecting themselves from their peers and employers.  In addition, the relationship between North and South Korea presents a number of concerns.

                <h3>LGBT and Womens Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    South Korea is currently having an issue with regard to its acceptance of LGBT individuals.  This is evidenced by strong opposition to LGBT events.  In a recent pride march celebration, 13,000 people participated, while 15,000 people showed up to protest the march.  I find this to be fascinating, as hatred and discrimination of LGBT members is in my mind a clear indicator that human rights are being neglected.  If any group who is not engaging in violent or harmful behaviors is being treated differently in any way, a human rights concern might be present.  It is the responsibility of government and leadership to punish discrimination of any kind in a harsh manner.  As it stands in South Korea, same-sex couples are not able to be recognized as being married.  This alone suggests that LGBT individuals are viewed as inherently different, and are simply not afforded the same rights as non-LGBT.<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/south-korea?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6vaqBhCbARIsACF9M6kG5UkrHGr8LJej1OKCVGNJ7JmurrQQZa-iHmo_2MJiM53giUNRUC4aAl7pEALw_wcB/#e81181" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>  I believe that discrimination against LGBT is a slippery slope that makes room for the dehumanization of innocent people, which is taking place in South Korea but also here in the United States.  It is undeniable that those who are openly LGBT are often subject to abuse, discrimination, and dehumanization.

                    As far as womens rights, we discussed in the previous post about the wage disparity as well as the lack of women in management positions.  Women are not adequately compensated for the work that they do, and they are often not respected in leadership roles.  On top of that they are subject to sexual harassment and assault, which is also a growing issue in the digital space.  In addition to these problems, women are unable to receive proper healthcare with regard to reproductive health and abortions.<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/south-korea?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6vaqBhCbARIsACF9M6kG5UkrHGr8LJej1OKCVGNJ7JmurrQQZa-iHmo_2MJiM53giUNRUC4aAl7pEALw_wcB/#d91ede" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>2</sup></a>

                <h3> Work Issues</h3>
                <p>
                    An area of concern lies in the state of South Korea's workplace.  29% of workers report having experience abuse from employers while on the job.  These abuses include 'verbal and physical bullying,' as well as refusal to pay workers on time.<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/south-korea?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6vaqBhCbARIsACF9M6kG5UkrHGr8LJej1OKCVGNJ7JmurrQQZa-iHmo_2MJiM53giUNRUC4aAl7pEALw_wcB/#e81181" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>  To make matters worse, there is a significant problem with ageism in the workplace.  Older people are often unable to find work, but if they do, they will be subjected to discrimination as a result of their age.  This is echoed by the fact that 40% of elderly people are currently living in poverty in South Korea.<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/19/time-running-out-south-korea-end-age-discrimination" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>  Elderly people must rely on the success of their offspring to have any chance of a comfortable life.  Without this, it is likely that they will slip into poverty, with very little chance of improving their situation.  Discriminating against potential employees because of age presents a human rights issue, especially if there are not adequate government programs to give aid to these people, as this leads to widespread poverty in older populations.  Workplace problems are related to homelessness, which although not as severe as in other developed nations, is still a problem in South Korea.  In particular, there is heavy stigmas associated with homelessness and disabilities, made worse by the fact that government policies fail to address how to help remedy the situation.<a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>5</sup></a>

                <h3>North Korea</h3>
                <p>
                    As it stands, the situation between North and South Korea is complex and extremely tense.  In the introduction post we discussed a bit of Korea's history including a brief overview of the Korea war, where Korea was effectively controlled by both Capitalist and Communist superpowers.  The resulting governments created two nations who were directly opposed to each other, with nothing but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/38th_parallel_north" target="_blank">38th parallel</a> to separate them.  Because of this, North Korean defectors often face discrimination and are shunned from public contact.  There are, however, government programs that educate these people and allow them to get become accustomed to modern life.  One defector described their situation with their statement "Here I know that if I try hard, I can have a better life"<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/N-Korea-at-crossroads/North-Korea-defector-tells-of-plight-as-Seoul-gets-tough-on-Pyongyang#:~:text=After%20leaving%20Hanawon%2C%20defectors%20often,family%20still%20in%20the%20North." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>6</sup></a> I found this particular statement to be incredibly powerful, as this was a core concept that was taught to me from my Korean family growing up.  It hits even closer to home considering my grandfather escaped North Korea during the war.  The defectors statement also embodies the human condition in a profound way, while also commenting on the fact that political systems can have drastic impacts on the outcomes of peoples lives.  Non-authoritarian countries with open markets, like modern day South Korea, give people the hope that they can improve their lives, which will motivate them to work and contribute to society, even in the face of discrimination and mistreatment.
