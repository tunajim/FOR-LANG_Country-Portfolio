                <h3>A Traditional Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>
                    Business in South Korea remains heavily influenced by lingering Confucian ideas and attitudes, which essentially hold that there are inequalities between people based on things like age or gender, and by respecting these hierarchies, society will be the most optimal.  This manifests businesses as being hierarchical, with job titles connotating rank over function.  They are also patriarchal, with very few women taking on leadership roles.  However, this is changing in younger populations, who do not adhere or accept current past ideas relating to gender, sexual orientation, etc.<a href="https://www.globalbusinessculture.com/cultural-awareness/business-culture-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>1</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Korean businesses also tend to be very competitive.  This includes both their commitment to whatever product or servie they are providing, but also within negotiations.  If someone appears to be weak or naive, they might try to manipulate the negotiation to best benefit themselves.  However, Koreans also value having a positive and friendly relationship with business partners, so they will often go out and share a meal as a part of their meetings.<a href="https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/south-korean-culture/south-korean-culture-business-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>2</sup></a>  Considering the history of the Korean Peninsula, it is understandable that the people would want to only do business with trusted parties.  When thinking about our class discussions of poverty and what leads to it in societies, the ways that South Korean businesses behave make me wonder if that is contributing to the problem of elderly poverty that we discussed in the previous post.  Because of the focus of efficiency and getting the most out of each business move, it is easy to see how eliminating elderly employees would theoretically increase profits.  I mentioned how the wage system is set up so that you gain raises according to time with the company.  Meaning that businesses understand employees will age and become less productive, while earning higher wages.  If they have a preference for young workers, they will have a higher workrate, at a much lower cost.  When all businesses are thinking this way, then you end up with a system where elderly people are unable to find adequate work.
