                <h3>Health care for all</h3>
                <p>
                    South Korean's value personal health, and their healthcare systems reflect those ideals.  All Korean citizens have access to universal healthcare, although it is not completely free, as there is about a 30% copay.  An organization known as the National Health Insurance Service(NHIS) subsidizes healthcare for South Korean citizens.  Because there is still a potentianlly significant cost associated with healthcare, Korean's can opt to add additional private insurance in addition to universal healthcare.  In fact, private insurances are available for foreigners as well.<a href="https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/systems/south-korea/#:~:text=Satisfaction%20with%20both%20access%20to,medical%20care%20through%20this%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>1</sup></a>  It is certainly a positive that health care is available to all Korean citizens and foreigners with insurance, but how good is the level of care?

                <p>
                    As far as quality goes, South Korea is ranked third in best health care systems in the world behind Singapore and Japan.<a href="https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>2</sup></a> People in South Korea have access to state of the art medical practices from both Eastern and Western disciplines, which provides a complete approach to staying healthy.  However, because the government is providing most of the finances to hospitals, healthcare workers are often overworked and underpaid.  Which presents some human rights concerns with regard to workplace conditions.  Perhaps the most significant problem with South Korean healthcare, is the state of mental health.  Korean's tend to feel shame over struggling with life circumstances and will often refuse to seek treatment or even disclose their conditions, which could explain why South Korea has the "highest suicide rate in the OECD."<a href="https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/systems/south-korea/#:~:text=Satisfaction%20with%20both%20access%20to,medical%20care%20through%20this%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>  Despite South Korea having made strides in providing state of the art health care to its people, cultural pressure and old ways of thinking cause people to neglect their mental health.
