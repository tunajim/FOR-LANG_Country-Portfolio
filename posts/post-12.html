                Thank you for reading the South Korea Country Blog!  Creating this blog was a fascinating experience for me, and I took many important things away from it.  Being a half-Korean person raised in the United States, I have spent much of my life knowing very little about my people or their history.  This assignment gave me the opportunity to explore my own culture and the values that it represents.  Immediately I can say that I have a deeper and more profound understanding of my Korean family as well as the Korean people overall.  Ideas I previously took as odd or even negative, now are clear and make sense.  Although many ideals pertaining to Confucian values still hold weight in South Korea, many aspects of the modern culture have been influenced by industrialization and imperialism.  The very existence of North and South Korea is a result of powerful nations, particularly the United States and Soviet Union, agreeing that the land should be divided into Capitalist and Communist territories.  The Korean's never had a say in this.  In addition, foreign nations were responsible for escalating warfare in the region.  At the end of the day, the people who were hurt by this, were the Korean civilians.  Subsequently, many of the values my family raised me with can be easily explained by these events.  We were raised to keep quiet, not rock the boat, and to out work our peers.  I see now that this way of living was simply a means of survival, and by working hard and educating oneself, you have some chance of living a good life.

                It was fascinating to compare the United States systems to that of South Korea.  Although, there are many differences, I found it interesting to think of how the United States has influenced South Korean culture.  Because of tensions with North Korea, the United States military has maintained a heavy presence in South Korea to mitigate the nuclear threat.  This constant exposure alongside many other factors, has inevitably led to subtle changes within the Korean culture.  For instance, the movement away from extended families to nuclear families, is a direct result of exposure to Western ideals.  This is a major factor leading into the elderly poverty issue being faced by the country.  This is just one way that South Korea has been influenced by large nations.  Going forward, we are going to continue to have increased globalization, meaning that nations will continue to integrate with each other.  How can we ensure that smaller nations are respected and preserved?  Doing this assignment put this question at the forefront of my mind.  It highlighted core concepts covered in class,  allowing us to dive deeper into each concept.  Understanding these concepts and applying them to cultural backgrounds and history, allows us to humanize and see each other as equals.  This is vital for promoting and maintaining human rights in a globalizing world, where everyday we are confronted with new cultures and new ideas.  It is up to us to understand each other, and we must be willing to put in the work towards achieving that.
