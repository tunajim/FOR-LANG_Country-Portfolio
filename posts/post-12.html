                Thank you for reading the South Korea Country Blog!  Creating this blog was a fascinating experience for me, and I took many important things away from it.  Being a half-Korean person raised in the United States, I have spent much of my life knowing very little about my people or their history.  This assignment gave me the opportunity to explore those things and learn about myself and my family.  Immediately I can say that I have a deeper and more profound understanding of my Korean family, and things I previously thought were odd or even negative, now make sense.  Although many ideals pertaining to Confucian values still hold weight in South Korea, it is clear that many aspects of the culture have been influenced as a result of industrialization and imperialism.  The very existence of North and South Korea is because of powerful nations, particularly the United States, and the Soviet Union, deciding that the land should be divided.  The Korean's never had a say in this.  In addition, foreign nations were responsible for escalating warfare in the region.  At the end of the day, the people who were hurt by this, were the Korean civilians.  Subsequently, many of the values my family raised me with can be easily explained by these wounds.  We were raised to keep quiet, not rock the boat, and to out work our peers.  I see now that this way of living was simply a means of survival, as for the ones that came before us, not adhering to these principles might have spelled suffering and death.

                It was fascinating to compare the United States systems to that of South Korea.  Although, there are many differences, I found it interesting to think of how the United States has influenced South Korean culture.  Because of tensions with North Korea, the United States military has maintained a heavy presence in South Korea to mitigate the nuclear threat.  This has inevitably led to subtle changes within the Korean culture.  For instance, the movement away from extended families to nuclear families, is a direct result of exposure to Western ideals.  This is a major factor leading into the elderly poverty issue that is currently a serious problem in the country.  This is just one way that South Korea has been influenced by large nations.  Going forward, we are going to continue to have increased globalization, meaning that nations will continue to integrate with each other.  How can we ensure that smaller nations cultures are respected and preserved?  Doing this assignment put this question at the forefront of my mind.  I feel that this assignment was adequate in terms of highlighting the core concepts that we covered in class, but also allowing us to dive deeper into each concept.  It provides new perspectives, and in my case, increased my compassion and understanding for others in general.  Understanding cultural backgrounds and history, allows us to humanize and see each other as equals.  This is vital for promoting and maintaining human rights in a globalizing world, everyday we are confronted with new cultures and new ideas, it is up to us to do the work to understand our peers, and in turn live peacefully alongside each other.
