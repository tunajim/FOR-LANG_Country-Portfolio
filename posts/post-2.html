                Post #2: Analysis of South Korean Immigration policies 
            </h2>
            <section class="default-flex gap">
                <h3>Attitudes Towards Immigration</h3>
                <p>
                    The current immigration rate in South Korea stands at 2.61 migrant(s) / 1,000 population.<a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/country-resource/korea-republic" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>  
                    Until the 1990's Korea had been relatively isolated due to its geographical location on the Korean Peninsula.  
                    As a result, the nation had undeveloped views of multi-cultural interactions.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9420350/" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>  
                    With a generally homogenous society, issues of racism and discrimination become prevalent when other cultures were
                    introduced. In the early 90's South Korea began accepting migrant workers in response to a weakening labor force, 
                    which was caused by declining birth rates and increasing labor costs.  In 1995, the "Myeong-Dong Migrant Labor Protest" 
                    took place to expose inhumane working conditions placed on migrant workers.<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13600820701202044" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>  
                    However, despite some improvement in attitudes towards immigrants, concerns about poor treatment of these migrant 
                    workers persists even into the present day.<a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-10-30/south-korea-labor-crisis-migrant-workers-unsafe-conditions" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>

                <h3>Refugees</h3>
                <p>
                    Although South Korea was the first East Asian country to join the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees" target="_blank">
                    Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a>, it is still notoriously difficult to gain refugee 
                    status. Since the year 1994, there has been a 6.7% rate of acceptance for refugees seeking asylum in 
                    South Korea.<a href="https://www.asiatoday.co.kr/view.php?key=20151014010007921" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a>
                    However, North Korean defectors are automatically granted South Korean citizenship.<a href="https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/the-people-who-left-the-peoples-republic-a-history-of-the-north-korean-diaspora" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a>

            <section class="default-flex gap">
                <h3>So What?</h3>
                <p>
                    Because of the geography of the Korean Peninsula, intercultural interactions are a more recent phenomena.
                    This is a common theme that is observable throughout the world as a result of globalization and was a 
                    topic of discussion in class.  How do we navigate coexisting with various cultures in a way that promotes 
                    harmony and peace?  These relationships are complex, and although communication is a vital aspect, it 
                    is not always an effective solution.  Learning about each others cultures from reputable sources within 
                    those communities is a starting point to breaking down cultural barriers.
