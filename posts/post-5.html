                Post 5: Political Issue: Gender Inequality

                <h3>Gender Roles in Korea</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditionally, there were strong gender roles present in Korean society, as they felt that certain activities were exclusive to men or women.  Women would typically take care of issues within the home while men would go out to work.  The sense of gender roles has persisted into modern times, with new problems such as wage disparity becoming an issue.  The wage gap in South Korea was 32.5% as compared to the OECD average of 12.5%, meaning that women are paid 32.5% less than men.<a href="https://www.oecd.org/country/korea/thematic-focus/gender-equality-korea-has-come-a-long-way-but-there-is-more-work-to-do-8bb81613/" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>  
                    It is difficult to classify South Korea as either Feminine or Masculine, based on Hofstede's ideas, but studies have found that South Koreans possess both high feminity and high masculinity scores.<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27749816?seq=11" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>  I agree with this conclusion, as the society appears to be heavily masculine on one hand, but has features of feminine society as well, especially with regard to men wearing make up.<a href="https://www.creatrip.com/en/blog/11276" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>  Having grown up as a half-Korean person, I typically got the sense that the culture put more emphasis on masculinity.  Family anecdotes echo this and describe the culture as patriarchal with masculine values being favored.  For instance, it was very well understood that men were leaders of the family, and their wives would tend to the homes while they went out and worked.  However, this could be that my family unit ran this way, which might not be representative of the entire culture.  An interesting point is that in 2022, roughly 70% of men, and 50% of women had active employment.  In addition, only about 20% of management roles were held by women.<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027699/south-korea-employment-rate-by-gender/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20employment%20rate,steadily%20over%20the%20past%20decade." target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a> There are a variety of potential explanations for the difference in employment, but all boil down to the fact that South Korea does have strict ideas about gender roles.  Which suggests a masculine culture.  In support of a more feminine society, Koreans do tend to place high value on relationships and fairness.  This is likely due to Confucianism having major influence in the region.<a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/43021/chapter-abstract/361417038?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a>

                <h3>Separation of Genders</h3>
                <p>
                There is an old Confucian ideal which states that boys and girls should be separated after a certain age.  This is still widely held in South Korea, but the reasoning is to prevent the likelihood of sex related crimes.<a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220218000624#:~:text=Gender%20segregation%20has%20deep%20roots,reaction%20to%20sex%20crime%20worries&text=%E2%80%9CBoys%20and%20girls%20shouldn't,even%20in%20present%2Dday%20Korea." target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a> Even when it comes to taxi services, there are accomodations put in place that ensure customers will be paired with a taxi driver who is the same legal sex.  Recently there has been debates over whether it should be allowed to separate even study rooms.  However, there are many who simply do not feel comfortable sharing spaces with other genders.  This is interesting especially considering how hotly debated the topic of gender is in the United States.  I do feel that separation of sexes is a naive solution to what is a human issue.  Genders do not determine the potential for sexual assault.<a href="http://endsexualviolence.rutgers.edu/prevention-and-education/lgbt/" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a>  Perhaps the answer lies in educating people about sex related issues and how to recognize and document sexual assault.  These incidents <em>must</em> be reported so that perpetrators may be harshly punished.  Community members must be incentivized with severe consequences should they choose to engage in this kind of behavior.
