                <p>
                    Education is extremely important to South Korean's, even to the point of it being detrimental to them.  There is a widely accepted belief that being well educated is the most important component of success in the modern world, which breeds an incredibly competitive environment where most people have highly developed skills.  Many students will spend just as much time in supplementary tutoring as they do at school, so the majority of their young lives are spent learning.  By the time they complete their college educations, they will be highly effective and skilled workers.  Besides increased competition, other consequences include physical damage to peoples eyes from over-studying and mental health complications.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118102555/http://www.saveourschools.com.au/national-issues/south-korea-education-success-has-a-dark-side" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>1</sup></a>  Speaking from personal experience, the amount of pressure to perform well in school just because of being Korean, is relentless.  It is funny though, that in my most recent conversations with Korean relatives, they seemed to think that I was making a mistake by not pursuing a career as a K-Pop idol.  Perhaps this suggests that attitudes towards education are beginning to change in the present day.  However, growing up here in the United States, it was clear from early on that we needed to work harder and be the best at what we did in order to find opportunities.  It seems that the same is true even in South Korea, where everyone shares a similar mindset.  This breeds a similar result, where a hyperfocus on educational achievement, leads to overly competitive markets that are saturated with high skill workers.  It is easy to see how this type of situation might lead one to sense of hopelessness, where they are unsure if their efforts will ever produce fruit.

                    Looking at the data however, it is clear that almost all South Koreans have at the very least, a basic education.  The literacy rate for the entire country is <a href="https://sites.miis.edu/southkoreaeducation/diversity-and-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>97.9%</strong></a>.  Compare this value to the United States, who has a 79% literacy rate.<a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179/index.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>2</sup></a>  The gap in literacy could be explained by the homogeneity of South Korea.  The people all value education, and the availability of public and private educational institutions give all citizens the opportunity to develop basic skills.  However, this does not tell the whole story, as being educated does not equate to having opportunities.  It without question creates the possibility for a better life, but it is not guaranteed.
