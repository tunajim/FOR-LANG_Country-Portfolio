                <h3>Environmental Issues in South Korea</h3>
                <p>
                    South Korea does not have a stellar reputation with regards to its policies on environmental protection. In comparison to other countries, South Korea is ranked eighth in the highest CO2 emissions.  Additionally, they are ranked the second worst country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for 'renewable' materials.<a href="https://www.sgi-network.org/2020/South_Korea/Environmental_Policies#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Korea%20officially%20announced,achieving%20carbon%20neutrality%20by%202050." target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> protecting
                    environments because the focus remains on developing products and turning profits.  Korea responded to the 2020
                    "Green New Deal" initiative with the promise of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  Albeit a fair precedent, there
                    is no tangible progress being made and no clear path for how this will be made a reality.  They even promised to 
                    implement a 'carbon tax' which would discourage people from purchasing carbon-based products.  However, this promise 
                    proved to be an empty one, as no tax has been implemented and the cost of carbon-based goods remains constant.<a href="https://www.sgi-network.org/2020/South_Korea/Environmental_Policies#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Korea%20officially%20announced,achieving%20carbon%20neutrality%20by%202050." target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> 
                    As a result, consumers are not being incentivized to change their purchasing patterns and will continue to prefer 
                    more affordable options.  In order for this strategy to carry any weight, consumers must be made to pay significantly
                    more for products that increase emissions, while simultaneously driving down prices for 'green' goods.  Consumers will
                    only change their purchasing behaviors if there is an adequate financial incentive for doing so.

                <h3>A Brighter Future</h3>
                <p>
                    Although it is clear that a more aggressive approach to climate protection could be taken in South Korea, there is hope that this could change in the future.  Youths have expressed concerns over the response to climate change and feel more should be done to mitigate the issue.  Young activists have filed legal complaints against the government claiming that the current efforts are 'unconstitutional' because they fail to protect young peoples livelihoods and futures.<a href="https://www.climatescorecard.org/2022/07/the-youth-voice-in-south-korea/#:~:text=The%20majority%20(79%25%2D94,may%20have%20on%20them%20personally." target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Humans have a long history of impacting their surrounding environments.  As groups began discovering agriculture, they had reason to transition out of nomadic/hunter-gatherer type societies to static, agriculturally based states.  Those settlements would inevitably grow and require more space and resources to operate.<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/development-agriculture/" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a>  However, the impact of this behavior began to take on a new form around the mid 1700's with the start of industrialization.  This is considered to be the point where we began having a tangible impact of the <em>entire</em> climate and ecosystems.  Widespread use of coal began, dramatically increasing green-house gas emissions.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8739025/" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a> 
                    Fastforwarding to present day it is abundantly clear -- to those not blinded by dogma -- that the burning and use of fossil fuels alongside increasing human activities, are undoubtebly having an impact of the environment and climate.  Despite this, it took South Korea until the year 2021 to announce a shift away from coal investment.<a href="https://www.sgi-network.org/2020/South_Korea/Environmental_Policies#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Korea%20officially%20announced,achieving%20carbon%20neutrality%20by%202050." target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a>  It is disheartening,
                    to say the least, that in the modern world people are still debating the very existence of climate change.  However, we must maintain hope that the next generations will make wiser choices.  Evidence shows that they are supportive of aggressive reform with regard to protecting the climate.  If immediate action is taken, we could significantly reduce our environmental impact as a species and hopefully leave behind a better world for our youth.
